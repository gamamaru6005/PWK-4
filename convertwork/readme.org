Work on converting pw_orig_utf8 to slp1.
Based on code in missing/

Nov 6:  In addition to changing from hk to slp1,  also 
  (a) Change ellipsis to space in {}, and in ‹zu›
  (b) Isolate Page breaks from Sanskrit
  (c) Isolate periods from Sanskrit.

python26 transcode.py 1 ../../orig/pw_orig_utf8.txt ../../orig/pw_orig_utf8_slp1.txt
Do the inverse conversion, back to hk:
python26 transcode.py 2 ../../orig/pw_orig_utf8_slp1.txt pw_orig_utf8_hk.txt
check the difference:
diff ../../orig/pw_orig_utf8.txt pw_orig_utf8_hk.txt > difforig

There are 64 differences - see difforig for details.
Some of these may lead to corrections.
However, since the number of differences is small, they are not
considered a material obstacle to proceeding with the use of 
pw_orig_utf8_slp1.txt.

test
python26 transcode.py 1 test_orig_utf8.txt test_orig_utf8_slp1.txt
python26 transcode.py 2 test_orig_utf8_slp1.txt test_orig_utf8_hk.txt
diff test_orig_utf8.txt test_orig_utf8_hk.txt > temp

Convert the old manualByLine files to slp1 form.
python26 transcode1.py 1 oldhk/manualByLine01.txt ../manualByLine01_slp1.txt

python26 transcode1.py 2  ../manualByLine01_slp1.txt manualByLine01_hk.txt
diff oldhk/manualByLine01.txt manualByLine01_hk.txt > diffmanual

There are 13 differences.  
We may have to adjust ../manualByLine01_slp1.txt manually.
However, these caused no problems, so are probably ok.
